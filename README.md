A simple Hangman game written in elixir. Based on the course [Elixir for Programmers](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers), by Dave Thomas.

## Running the Project

To run the text client, you can run the following:

```
$ cd elixir-hangman/text_client
$ mix run -e TextClient.start
```

# Running the tests
As of now there is no comprehensive way to run all of the tests. In order to run the tests in each project you must cd into the project directory and run `mix test`. E.g.

```
$ cd elixir-hangman/hangman
$ mix test
```
